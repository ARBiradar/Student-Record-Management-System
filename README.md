# Student-Record-Management-System
This is a command-line based Student Record Management System built in Java that allows users to add, view, update, and delete student records. It uses an ArrayList to manage Student objects dynamically, making it ideal for practicing CRUD operations and object-oriented programming.

In this CLI-based Student Record Management System, the following core operations are performed:

Add Student: Insert a new student record by entering ID, name, and marks.

View Students: Display all existing student records in a readable format.

Update Student: Modify the name and marks of a student using their ID.

Delete Student: Remove a studentâ€™s record permanently based on their ID.

Exit: End the application safely.

These operations offer a hands-on way to practice CRUD concepts using Java, data handling with ArrayList, and user interaction through console-based menus.
